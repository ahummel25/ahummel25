# Hi, I'm Andrew 👋

I'm a software engineer focused on building reliable, well-integrated systems with a strong emphasis on developer experience, correctness, and long-term maintainability.

---

## 🧑‍💻 What I work on

* **Backend & integrations** — APIs, third-party integrations, background jobs, and service-oriented architectures
* **Cloud & infrastructure** — production systems running on AWS & GCP
* **Developer experience** — testing, tooling, and making complex systems easier to work with

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

* **Languages:** Ruby, Go, TypeScript, JavaScript
* **Frameworks:** Rails, React, Next.js
* **Datastores:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
* **Infra & tooling:** Docker, Terraform, Sidekiq, GitHub Actions

---

## 🧠 How I think about engineering

* Prefer **clarity over cleverness**
* Ship in **small, verifiable increments**
* Design for **failure modes**, not just happy paths
* Optimize for **maintainability and observability**

---

## 📌 Current interests

* Improving reliability and error handling in distributed systems
* Designing clean integration boundaries
* Reducing operational overhead through better tooling
